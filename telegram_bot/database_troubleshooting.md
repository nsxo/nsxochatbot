# 🔧 Database Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Database Issues & Solutions

### ❌ "Database URL not found"
**Cause**: PostgreSQL service not added to Railway project
**Solution**: 
1. Railway Dashboard → Your Project → "+ New Service" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Redeploy your bot service

### ❌ "Connection pool exhausted"
**Cause**: Too many simultaneous database connections
**Solution**: 
- Check Railway logs for connection leaks
- Restart the service in Railway dashboard

### ❌ "relation 'users' does not exist"
**Cause**: Schema creation failed
**Solution**:
1. Check bot has DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Redeploy to trigger schema creation
3. Look for "Database schema ensured" in logs

### ❌ "psycopg2 not available"
**Cause**: Missing PostgreSQL client library (normal during build)
**Solution**: This is expected during Railway build - ignore this message

### ✅ Success Indicators

Look for these messages in Railway logs:
```bash
✅ Initializing PostgreSQL connection pool
✅ Database schema ensured
✅ Bot setup completed successfully!
```

## Database Health Check

Your bot automatically:
- ✅ Creates all required tables
- ✅ Sets up proper indexes and constraints  
- ✅ Handles schema updates
- ✅ Manages connection pooling
- ✅ Provides error recovery

## Manual Database Access (if needed)

1. **Railway Dashboard** → **PostgreSQL Service** → **Data Tab**
2. **View Tables**: Check if tables exist
3. **Run Queries**: Test database manually

## Architecture Summary

Your database setup is **production-ready** with:
- 🏭 Connection pooling for performance
- 🔄 Automatic schema management
- 🛡️ Error handling and retries
- 📊 Transaction safety
- 🚀 Railway-optimized deployment

**No manual database setup required - everything is automated!**
